# Introduction

Welcome to Lost Island! This is a small text-based game where your mission is to find a way out of the island. You will be given choices and you must make decisions to progress through the game. Be careful though, some choices can lead to unexpected outcomes!

# How to Play

To play the game, simply run the script in a Python environment. The game will ask you which way you would like to go, right or left. Type your choice and press enter.

If you choose left, you will be presented with another choice to swim or wait. If you choose to wait, you will be given another choice to choose between a ship, a helicopter, and a girl. Your choice will determine the outcome of the game.

If you choose right, you will fall into the ocean and the game will end.
